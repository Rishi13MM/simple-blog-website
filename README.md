# 🚀 HTML & CSS Practice Project

This project was built as part of my learning journey while following along with [Jonas Schmedtmann’s](https://www.udemy.com/user/jonasschmedtmann/) excellent **"Build Responsive Real-World Websites with HTML and CSS"** course on Udemy.

💻 All code is written by me and intended purely for educational and practice purposes.

📝 This is a static blog-style webpage that focuses on:
- Semantic HTML structure
- Clean layout using meaningful tags
- Preparing the foundation for CSS styling

Stay tuned — CSS styling coming next!
